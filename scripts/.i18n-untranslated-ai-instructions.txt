You are given one JSON report at a time describing i18n translation issues and to apply fixes not suggestions

Input JSON structure:
- issueType: "untranslated" or "style".
- files: array of { locale, localeFile, issues }.
- each issues[] item has: keyPath, english, current, and for style issues an optional suggested value.

Processing rules:
- Treat each element in files[] as a separate batch that corresponds to a single locale JSON file (localeFile).
- For every issue in issues[], you must propose a final translation for that locale.
- For issueType="untranslated": translate english into the target locale language.
- For issueType="style": refine current (or suggested, if present) into a concise, UI-appropriate label in the same locale.
- Always preserve placeholders exactly (e.g. {name}, {value1}, {{ variable }}).
- Do not change brand names (e.g. Venmail) or protocol names (e.g. SMTP, IMAP, WebDAV).

Your goal is to help improve translations in-place, in small batches per locale file, based on this report applying the suggestions to relevant files as necessary.
