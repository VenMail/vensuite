# The $10K Problem

## "I only create email accounts for the operations team" — Sandra - SheCodes

### Customer Pain Points

#### Sarah - TechStart: "Drowning in subscriptions"
- We're using Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid, and Mailchimp separately
- **Impact**: A seeming lack of coordination/harmony, juggling becomes the norm

#### Mike - GrowthCo: "Scared to hire"
- Every time we hire someone, our software costs go up $200-500
- **Impact**: Per user pricing makes growth expensive and fear inducing

#### Jennifer - MarketingOps: "Literally copy-pasting all day"
- Our team spends hours each week copying data between different tools
- **Impact**: Repetitive redundant tasks = more stress and output quality drop

#### David - CustomerSuccess: "I just manage everything in excel"
- Customer information is scattered across 5 different platforms
- **Impact**: Extra work to maintain synchronized reliable customer data

<!--

Presenter Notes:
- Use dramatic red gradient for urgency
- Slide right transition emphasizes problem discovery
- Stagger problem reveals for impact
- Each problem should have emotional weight
